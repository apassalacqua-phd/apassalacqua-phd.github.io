          <h5>Personal Biography & Research Background</h5>

          <p>
            I am a financial economist with a strong background in applying economic 
            and financial analysis to answer policy-related questions. 
            I have held positions in both the government and the private sector and 
            have extensive experience working with large financial datasets, sophisticated 
            econometric models, simulations and forecasting. 
          </p>

          <p>  
            Previously, I was an associate at Analysis Group, a leading financial consulting 
            firm in the litigation industry. I began my career as a financial 
            economist at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System where I worked 
            on issues related to the microeconomic and macroeconomic implications of banking 
            regulations and supervision for the financial markets and the real economy.
          </p>

          <p> 
            My research interests include financial intermediation, macroeconomics, household 
            finance, corporate finance, venture capital, private equity, and entrepreneurship. 
          </p>

          <p>                     
          More recently, I have developed a growing interest in the impact of Artificial Intelligence 
          (AI), particularly how advances in AI are reshaping financial services and marketsâ€”from credit 
          allocation and investment strategies to consumer access and risk management. 
          I am also exploring how AI is transforming labor markets, firm productivity and organization, 
          and entrepreneurship, and what these shifts imply for long-term economic growth and inequality.
          </p>

          <p>
            I obtained a Ph.D. and a M.A. from{" "}

             in Spring 2020 under the
            supervision of Jeremy Stein (chair), Josh Lerner, David Scharfstein,
            Marco Di Maggio, and Adi Sunderam. I received a BSc and MSc in Economics from Bocconi University.
