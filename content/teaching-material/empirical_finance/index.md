**Course Description and Overview**

This course introduces students to the empirical methods used in finance, with a strong emphasis on practical application. We will explore the extensive empirical literature that analyzes movements in security prices, evaluates investment and asset pricing models, and tests these models to interpret their implications. While the course builds on the program’s econometrics sequence, the focus is on applying these techniques to real-world financial data and problems — including event studies, the analysis of short- and long-run stock returns, multi-factor models, and credit risk analysis.
In addition to traditional approaches in financial econometrics, the course integrates predictive modeling techniques from data science, including applications in “Big Data” environments. Students will work with standard financial datasets and gain experience in designing, coding, and analyzing models commonly used in industry.
The course structure and assignments are designed to reflect the types of tasks students are likely to encounter in professional roles in the finance industry — including positions at commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, mutual funds, non-banking financial institutions, central banks, consulting firms, and government agencies. Students will complete a hands-on group project involving data analysis, professional visualization of results, and in-class presentation or reporting. The goal is to equip students with the skills and experience needed to transition smoothly into applied roles in finance and related fields.
