Topics include: multiple regression, regression with discrete random variables, instrumental variables regression, analysis of random experiments and quasi- experiments, and regression with time series data, including applications to ”big data”. Students will learn how to conduct and critique empirical studies. The course emphasizes empirical applications; the mathematical theory of econometrics will be introduced only as needed and will not be a central focus. Students seeking a treatment of econometric theory with a higher level of mathematics should take Economics 1126.
