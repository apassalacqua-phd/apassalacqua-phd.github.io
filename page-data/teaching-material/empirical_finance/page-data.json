We will explore the extensive empirical literature that analyzes movements in security prices, evaluates investment and asset pricing models, and tests these models to interpret their implications. While the course builds on the program’s econometrics sequence, the focus is on applying these techniques to real-world financial data and problems — including event studies, the analysis of short- and long-run stock returns, multi-factor models, and credit risk analysis.\nIn addition to traditional approaches in financial econometrics, the course integrates predictive modeling techniques from data science, including applications in “Big Data” environments. Students will work with standard financial datasets and gain experience in designing, coding, and analyzing models commonly used in industry.\nThe course structure and assignments are designed to reflect the types of tasks students are likely to encounter in professional roles in the finance industry — including positions at commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, mutual funds, non-banking financial institutions, central banks, consulting firms, and government agencies. Students will complete a hands-on group project involving data analysis, professional visualization of results, and in-class presentation or reporting. The goal is to equip students with the skills and experience needed to transition smoothly into applied roles in finance and related fields.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p>\n<p>By the end of this course, students will be able to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Acquire foundational knowledge of empirical methods in finance;</li>\n<li>Be familiar with time-series and cross-sectional properties of asset returns;</li>\n<li>Learn how to apply modern econometric methods to important questions in finance;</li>\n<li>Gain experience in working with real data using python.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The finance core.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Required Texts &#x26; Learning Materials</strong>\nThere is no textbook required for this course.
