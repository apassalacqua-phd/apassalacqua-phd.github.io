Using a novel confidential dataset containing consumer complaints from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and matching it with confidential data on mortgages, deposits, and market prices, we find that banks subject to prudential and CFPB oversight, which receive consumer complaints experience a decline in their share prices and an increase in trading volumes. These banks also see a decrease in deposit and mortgage market shares, with more complaints resulting in higher deposit withdrawals. We find limited evidence that banks change deposit rates in response. Finally, we implement textual analysis to study the differential impact of consumer complaints. First, we identify the main topics related to the complaints. Second, we find that consumer disappointment is associated with a decrease in aggregate deposits. Overall, we provide new evidence on the role of information disclosure as a disciplinary mechanism in providing credit.

Combining a novel administrative dataset of unexpected bank inspections with a quasi-random selection of inspected banks in Italy, we show that inspected banks are more likely to reclassify loans as non performing after an audit. This behavior suggests that banks are inclined to misreport loan losses and evergreen credit to underperforming ﬁrms unless audited. We ﬁnd that this reclassiﬁcation of loans leads to a temporary contraction in lending by audited banks. However, this eﬀect is completely driven by a credit cut to underperforming ﬁrms, as the composition of new lending shifts toward more productive ﬁrms. As a result, these productive ﬁrms increase employment and invest more in ﬁxed capital. We provide evidence of a mechanisms for our results: a change in bank governance. Finally, we ﬁnd positive spillovers from inspections: entrepreneurship increases, underperforming ﬁrms are more likely to exit the market, and there is an overall increase in productivity in the local economy as a result. Taken together, our results show that bank supervision is an important complement to regulation in improving credit allocation.\n","cover":{"publicURL":"/static/a1f6cc2f55bfd799db03123a49785748/cover_bank.png"}}},{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/research/the-role-of-information/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Role of Information in the Corporate Governance of Firms","description":"with Jiakai Chen (University of Hawaii Shidler College of Business) Teng Wang (Fed Board)","category":"research","subCategory":"Work in Progress","sortOrder":5,"primaryButtonTitle":null,"secondaryButtonTitle":null,"secondaryButtonLink":null,"tertiaryButtonTitle":null,"tertiaryButtonContent":null,"cover":{"publicURL":"/static/92516e047f90e8d30e04bee45265e9fb/cover.png"}}},{"excerpt":"Handbook of Macroeconomics, Volume 2, 2016, Pages 2599-2651 Summary: Governments often accumulate more debt than what would be considered…","fields":{"slug":"/research/the-political-economy-of-government-deb-with-alberto-alesina/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Political Economy of Government Debt","description":"with Alberto Alesina (Harvard University)","category":"research","subCategory":"Publications","sortOrder":1,"primaryButtonTitle":null,"secondaryButtonTitle":"Read full paper","secondaryButtonLink":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2706322","tertiaryButtonTitle":"Read abstract","tertiaryButtonContent":"This paper reviews the political economy literature on why governments often accumulate more debt than what would be considered optimal according to fiscal policy prescriptions.
