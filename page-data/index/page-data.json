Using the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) complaints data, we find banks subject to prudential CFPB oversight that receive consumer complaints experience a decline in uninsured deposits and respond by increasing offered deposit rates. We also analyze the content of consumer complaints in several ways. First, we find that complaints relating to bank accounts see a larger decline in deposits. Next, we leverage artificial intelligence (AI) tools to explore additional complaint classifications. Using topics identified by ChatGPT, we find complaints containing information on resolution expectations do not lead to similar deposit declines. Overall, our findings provide new evidence on the role of consumer complaints disclosure as a disciplinary mechanism and underscore the potential of AI tools to enhance the classification of complaints and support regulatory oversight.","cover":{"publicURL":"/static/55d801e362ca54fa44b9f1b3e01e8d86/cover_CFPB1.png"}}},{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/research/event-studies-litigation/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Event Studies in Litigation Cases: A Guide for Practitioners","description":null,"category":"research","subCategory":"Work in Progress","sortOrder":7,"primaryButtonTitle":null,"secondaryButtonTitle":null,"secondaryButtonLink":null,"tertiaryButtonTitle":null,"tertiaryButtonContent":null,"cover":{"publicURL":"/static/5658322700127686436182cd17709ad4/cover3.png"}}},{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/research/fintech/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Revolution or Risk?

Combining a novel administrative dataset of unexpected bank inspections with a quasi-random selection of inspected banks in Italy, we show that inspected banks are more likely to reclassify loans as non performing after an audit. This behavior suggests that banks are inclined to misreport loan losses and evergreen credit to underperforming ﬁrms unless audited. We ﬁnd that this reclassiﬁcation of loans leads to a temporary contraction in lending by audited banks. However, this eﬀect is completely driven by a credit cut to underperforming ﬁrms, as the composition of new lending shifts toward more productive ﬁrms. As a result, these productive ﬁrms increase employment and invest more in ﬁxed capital. We provide evidence of a mechanisms for our results: a change in bank governance. Finally, we ﬁnd positive spillovers from inspections: entrepreneurship increases, underperforming ﬁrms are more likely to exit the market, and there is an overall increase in productivity in the local economy as a result. Taken together, our results show that bank supervision is an important complement to regulation in improving credit allocation.","cover":{"publicURL":"/static/a1f6cc2f55bfd799db03123a49785748/cover_bank.png"}}},{"excerpt":"","fields":{"slug":"/research/the-role-of-information/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Role of Information in the Corporate Governance of Firms","description":"with Jiakai Chen (University of Hawaii Shidler College of Business) Teng Wang (Fed Board)","category":"research","subCategory":"Work in Progress","sortOrder":5,"primaryButtonTitle":null,"secondaryButtonTitle":null,"secondaryButtonLink":null,"tertiaryButtonTitle":null,"tertiaryButtonContent":null,"cover":{"publicURL":"/static/92516e047f90e8d30e04bee45265e9fb/cover.png"}}},{"excerpt":"Course Description and Overview This course introduces students to the empirical methods used in finance, with a strong emphasis on…","fields":{"slug":"/teaching-material/empirical_finance/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Empirical Finance","description":"John Hopkins University Carey Business School - Master in Finance","category":"teaching-material","subCategory":null,"sortOrder":null,"primaryButtonTitle":"Get Material","secondaryButtonTitle":null,"secondaryButtonLink":null,"tertiaryButtonTitle":null,"tertiaryButtonContent":null,"cover":null}},{"excerpt":"A referee report is an essential part of the peer review process in academic publishing.
